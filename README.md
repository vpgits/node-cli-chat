# node-cli-chat

This project was done in a rush to basically make me a bit familar with how web works and break the ice on JavaScript. 
However this project ran into a **few challenges**.

##
- Project used **socket.io**, a popular npm repository
- No persistance has been attempted
- Uses socket io for both **server and client** along with **express**
- **readline** package was troublesome to deal with, considering it wrecked the whole UI/UX experience

However this project still meets upto its intended purpose. 

#chatgpt was used to plan out the coding process.
